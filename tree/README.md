just one problem with pitch, it like flips the arithmetic when you hit horizontal lool.

tree is parameterized, now make it procedural

and do other trees? ambitious lol

so its like:

def make_tree(start plane):
    next_plane = whatever
    if trunk:
        make_tree(next_plane)
    else:
        make_tree(next_plane)
        branch_plane = whatever
        make_tree(branch_plane)

    ...

    if end:
        make leaves


bug:

depends on axis.y so horizontal = flat lol

twisty boys

dumb elipses (works for sphere though)

raymarched leaves?

ok so it gets taller as height is lower
and fucked by number of polys
